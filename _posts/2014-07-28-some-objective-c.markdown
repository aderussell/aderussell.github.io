You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight objc %}
#define VALUE 3.0
- (void)makeBigString:(NSString *)aString
{
    BOOL hi = YES;
    // appends "hello message" to end of input string;
    return [aString stringByAppendingString:@" hello!"];
}
{% endhighlight %}
