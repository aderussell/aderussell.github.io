## Experience

### Software Engineer - JustEat (2019 - Present)

* Ensure and maintain a high level of accessibility in our iOS consumer applications. This initially involved a large audit to discover all issues when using our applications with Voice Over and Voice Control, planning how best to fix those issues, and then coordinate the implementation of those fixes. It now continues by working with developers to  ensure high standards in new features and performing regular auditing to avoid regressions.
* Maintain and extend the controls and visual theming module used within all our consumer applications. Implemented a system to publish our theming showcase app for members of the design team to review and use as reference.
* Managed and executed the 2020 (Project Orange) re-theming of our iOS consumer applications.
* Implemented the new PIE theming system, and associated controls, which will be used throughout our consumer applications going forward.
* As part of the Customer Conversion Squad, implemented the ‘Favourites reorder’ feature which made selecting previously order dished easier. This feature produced a 0.6% uplift in order conversions. Also implemented the ‘Active basket finder’ feature which made it easier for users to find their current basket. Nominated for ‘standout collaboration’ while within the squad.
* Assisted in modernisation efforts by converting parts of the legacy Objective-C codebase into swift. This included re-writing large parts of checkout module to make it more readable, testable, and extendable.
* Worked on the Release Squad to ensure that the consumer apps were released smoothly and monitored their rollout to anticipate issues and coordinate mitigation actions.

### Software Developer - Createanet (2016 - 2019)

* Responsible for the implementation and maintenance of numerous iOS & Android applications for clients. 
	This involves taking an interactive prototype and list of requirements and implementing all user interfaces and functionality then testing and documenting the resultant code base.
* Took ownership of projects produced by previous developers that need to be updated and modernise, refactor, and document them, while updating the applications for new project requirements, to make future maintenance faster and easier.
* Design and document RESTful web APIs for various projects that are being produced by both myself and other colleagues to make development of multiple client application faster as they could be developed along side the API rather than having to wait for it's completion so the public endpoints are known.
* I have also suggested a number of ideas for improving implementation of industry standards and good practices such as structured project documentation and systematic testing.

### Software Developer - University of Plymouth (2012 - 2015)

* Maintained and expanded existing iOS applications used by clinicians for assessing patients. These apps have been used in multiple clinical studies.
* Collaborate closely with clinicians and team members to plan & design robust, simple to use products.
* Produced and maintain ACEmobile; an iPad based application, for assisting in assessing dementias, available in iOS App Store. This included creating the app in Objective-C, a RESTful server in PHP 5.3, and database in MySQL.
* Produced and maintained EpSMon; an award-winning iPhone based epilepsy self-monitor available in iOS App Store. This included creating the app in Objective-C, a RESTful server in PHP 5.6, a database in MySQL, and an interactive website using ember.js. I also supervised the development of the Android version.
* Implemented new internal procedures for code versioning, testing, documenting, and deployment of applications.
* Interviewed, trained and worked alongside a student software developer.
* Maintained internal server which houses ACEmobile web server and database.
* Maintained external server (AWS) which houses EpSMon web server and database.
* Engage in considerable independent learning into technologies and methodologies needed for new projects.
