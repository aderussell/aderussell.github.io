<p class="intro">ARPhysics is a 2D-based real-time physics engine, written by me, as my final-year Computer Science undergraduate project while at the University of Plymouth.</p>


<h3>The Structure of ARPhysics</h3>
ARPhysics takes the form of a static library that can be linked to in any other project. It is written using only standard C++11 and the supplied standard libraries so it can be complied for any platform using a compliant compiler.

<!--<h3>world
bodies
spatial indexing
force generator
constraints</h3>-->
